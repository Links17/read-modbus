### Modbus Data Reader with Image Capture

This Go program sets up an HTTP server that reads Modbus data and captures an image based on certain conditions. It then
generates a JSON response containing the image data, area, and coordinates.

#### Usage

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```
   go get github.com/disintegration/imaging
   go get github.com/goburrow/modbus
   ```
3. Run the program by executing:
   ```
   go run main.go
   ```
4. Access the server at `http://localhost:2005/read-modbus` to trigger Modbus data reading and image capture.

#### Endpoints

- **GET /read-modbus**: Triggers the Modbus data reading and image capture process. Returns a JSON response containing
  the captured image data, area, and coordinates.

#### Dependencies

- [disintegration/imaging](https://github.com/disintegration/imaging): Image processing library.
- [goburrow/modbus](https://github.com/goburrow/modbus): Modbus client library.

#### How It Works

1. The program establishes a Modbus RTU connection and reads various Modbus registers.
2. If the specified time interval has passed, the program triggers image capture through Modbus commands.
3. The captured image is processed and a bounding box is drawn around a specified area.
4. The resulting image data, area value, and coordinates are returned in a JSON response.

#### Note

- Make sure to configure the Modbus connection parameters and Modbus register addresses according to your setup.
- Adjust the image processing and drawing logic as needed for your application.
